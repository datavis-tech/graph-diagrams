This program renders a network diagram for a [ModelJS](https://github.com/curran/model) reactive flow.

The input data is generated by an [experimental ModelJS branch](https://github.com/curran/model/tree/flow-graph-detection) that computes the reactive flow graph at runtime.

Based on a [previous implementation from July 2014](https://github.com/curran/model/tree/5a30cc7647d970e452bbe10ef458c40a25d825c6/examples/dataFlowDiagram)
